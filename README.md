# Radiative Forcing (Science Etonnante)

- Toy-model to simulate the atmosphere radiative transfer and compute the radiative forcing as a function of 
the quantity of CO2. 
- Use only one CO2 absorption band (≃ 15 µm).
- The model output a radiative forcing of 4.8W/m2 for CO2 going from pre-industrial 280 ppm to 560 ppm (x2). 
- The currently best estimate by scientists (with better code and richer input data) is about 3.7 W/m2.
